    <p>
      A Browser's viewport is the area of the web page in which the content is
      visible to the user. The viewport does not have the same size, it varies
      with the variation in screen size of the devices on which the website is
      visible. For a laptop, the viewport has a larger size as compared to a
      smartphone or tablet.

      When a page is not made responsive for smaller viewports it looks bad or
      even breaks on a smaller screen. To fix this problem introduce a
      responsive tag to control the viewport. This tag was first introduced by
      Apple Inc. for Safari iOS.
